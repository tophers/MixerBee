# MixerBee üêù

**MixerBee** is a self-hosted web app for building and updating smart playlists and collections on your [Emby](https://emby.media/) server. Mix episodes from multiple shows, create movie collections that fit your criteria, or schedule block-style programming to mimic a TV channel.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Advanced Playlist & Collection Builder**:
    *   **TV Blocks**: Mix episodes from multiple shows. Start from a specific episode or let MixerBee automatically find the next unwatched one for you.
    *   **Movie Blocks**: Filter your movie library by genre, year range, watched status, and more to create highly specific lists.
    *   **Create as Collection**: Generate a static **Collection** in your Emby library instead of a playlist for easier visual navigation.
*   **AI Block Builder** (Optional): Use natural language to build complex playlists. Simply ask for what you want (e.g., "80s action movies and some episodes of Star Trek"), and let the AI generate the playlist blocks for you. *Requires a Google Gemini API key.*
*   **Scheduler**: Automatically rebuild your favorite presets on a daily or weekly schedule. Set your "prime time" or "Saturday morning cartoon" blocks once and always have fresh content ready. Includes a "Last Run" status to monitor job success.
*   **Manager**: A unified dashboard to view, search, sort, and delete all of your Playlists and Collections in one place.
*   **Quick Playlists**: Instantly create special playlists with a single click.
    *   **Pilot Sampler**: Discovers shows you haven't started and creates a playlist of their pilot episodes.
    *   **Next Up**: Creates a playlist of the next unwatched episode from your most recently watched shows.
    *   **From the Vault**: Creates a playlist of favorited movies you haven't watched in over a year.
    *   **Genre Roulette**: Picks a random genre from your library and creates a movie marathon.
*   **Modern UI**: A clean, responsive interface with both **Light and Dark modes**.
*   **Preset System**: Save your complex builder configurations as presets. Import and export presets via shareable text codes to share with friends.

    *   **Add Blocks**: Add TV or Movie "blocks" to design a custom content lineup.
    *   **Build**: Use the Action Bar at the bottom to give your creation a name and build it as either a static Playlist or a Collection inside Emby.

    2.  Go to the "Scheduler" tab.
    3.  Select your saved preset, choose a frequency (Daily or Weekly), pick the days, and set a time.
