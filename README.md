# MixerBee üêù

**MixerBee** is a self-hosted web app for building and managing smart playlists and collections on your [Emby](https://emby.media/) or [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) server. It started as a basic CLI tool to interleave episodes from multiple shows, and has evolved into a fully-featured web-based scheduler and media playlist manager.

Mix episodes across shows, create themed movie blocks, blend music from your favorite artists, or schedule block-style programming to mimic a custom TV channel.
